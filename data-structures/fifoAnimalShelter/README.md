# Animal Shelter Queue Implementation
The challenge was to reate a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats. The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach.



#### Node Class properties:

val - The val stored in the Node
next - A pointer the next Node in the list

#### Animal Class properties;
  * which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue with an O(1) Time performance.

#### Dog Class properties;


#### Cat Class porperties;





#### DogAndCatShelter  Class properties

`enqueue()`

  * which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue with an O(1) Time performance.

`dequeue()`

  * that does not take any argument, removes the node from the front of the queue, and returns the nodeâ€™s value.
