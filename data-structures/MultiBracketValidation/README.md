# Linked List Implementation
The challenge was to create three classes, Node, Stack and Queue. 

#### Node Class properties:

val - The val stored in the Node
next - A pointer the next Node in the list

#### Stack Class properties

`pop()`

  * that does not take any argument, removes the node from the top of the stack, and returns the nodeâ€™s value.

`push()`

  * which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack with an O(1) Time performance.

`peek()`

  * that does not take an argument and returns the value of the node located on top of the stack, without removing it from the stack.

`isempty()`

  * that takes no argument, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the stack is empty.

#### Queue Class properties

`enqueue()`

  * which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue with an O(1) Time performance.
